# Venux-iCloud
Venux IOS iCloud Activation


Welcome to Venux

A newly and stable iCloud Activation unit allowing our users to bypass iCloud using Setup.App and multiple offline and online patches.
supporting most latest A5-A12 Chipsets, bare in mind our exploit is still experimental so we appreciate any bug reports from our users. Please create a bug report using GitHub so we can
respond to it as quickly as we can.

We are planning on using a BIO-GUI meaning we are able to execute a full exploit to your iDevice using a GUI based form with a background running console doing all the work as fast as possible,
our tool also supports HFC Flashing meaning that your flashing will be 100% mountable and safe to use on your iDevice. Flashing can take up to 20 minutes per IPSW file but each file is compiled
with perfection it is best to leave it while creating IPSW's and Flashing Processe(s)

Created in Our Homes in California!
